# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for RemitX. ADRs document significant design decisions so that contributors can understand *why* the codebase is built the way it is — not just *what* it does.

RemitX uses the [MADR format](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Architecture Decision Records).

## ADR Lifecycle

Each ADR passes through the following states:

```
Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated (optional) → Superseded (optional)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Proposed** | The ADR has been drafted and is open for discussion in a PR. |
| **Accepted** | The PR has been merged; the decision is in effect. |
| **Deprecated** | The decision is no longer followed but the ADR is kept for historical context. |
| **Superseded** | A newer ADR overrides this one. The old ADR links to the replacement. |

## When to Write an ADR

An ADR is required when a PR:

- Introduces or replaces a third-party dependency with significant surface area (SDK, auth library, off-ramp provider)
- Changes the smart-contract storage schema in a way that requires migration
- Alters the oracle attestation or signature protocol
- Selects between two or more substantially different design approaches
- Changes the settlement layer, token standard, or corridor-support model
- Modifies the admin or multi-sig governance model

For smaller implementation choices (e.g., which iterator method to use), a PR comment is sufficient.

## How to Propose an ADR

1. **Pick a number.** Use the next available ADR number after the last entry in the index above.
2. **Copy the template.** `cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/ADR-NNN-short-title.md`
3. **Fill in the template.** Mark status as `Proposed`. Fill in all sections.
4. **Open a PR.** The ADR can be included in the feature PR that implements the decision, or as a standalone `docs/` PR.
5. **Get review.** At least one maintainer must review the ADR before it is merged.
6. **Update status on merge.** The merging maintainer updates the status to `Accepted` and adds the ADR to the index table above.

## How to Deprecate or Supersede an ADR

If a future decision overturns an existing one:

1. Create the new ADR (e.g., `ADR-009-...`) with status `Accepted`.
2. In the new ADR's **Supersedes** field, reference the old ADR.
3. In the old ADR, update its status to `Superseded` and add a link: `Superseded by [ADR-009](ADR-009-...)`.
4. Update the index table in this file.

Do **not** delete old ADRs. The historical record of why decisions were made — including decisions that turned out to be wrong — is valuable.
